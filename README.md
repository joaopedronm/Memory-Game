## Memory Game - Vikings üë®‚Äçüíª ‚öîÔ∏è

This project is a memory game based on one of my favorite series: **Vikings**.

Here I created two pages: the first one is a login page that takes the username and save on Local Storage. The second one it's the game itself. A game composed by 28 cards representing 14 characters from the serie (Ragnar, Bjorn, Lagherta, Ivar, Ecbert, etc.).

I hope you enjoy It! :slightly_smiling_face:
